# Weather App

This is a Web App built with React that provides an 8-day forecast of any location in the world that you give as input. The geocoding is done by using [opencage](https://opencagedata.com/) API and the forecast data is obtained from the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) Api. This App also provides hourly forecasting for any of the days you want.
